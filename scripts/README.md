# Scripts
This directory contains some of the scripts useful for this project.

### Usage
0. Install Python 3.10 or newer
1. Go to this directory if not done so already (`cd scripts`)
2. Create and activate a virtual environment with python3: `mkdir .venv; python3 -m venv .venv; source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the dependencies: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. This installs the dependencies required for any of the scripts in this directory, so you can go ahead and just run anything!

## Sine wave modulation calculation
The `sine_wave_modulation.py` script generates a set of plots and maths related to 
modulating a sine wave on a PWM signal. 

### Usage
0. Activate the virtual environment (described in scripts/usage above)
1. Run the script: `python3 sine_wave_modulation.py`
